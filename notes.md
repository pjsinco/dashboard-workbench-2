> CSS transitions work by defining two states for the object using CSS. In your case, you define how the object looks when it has the class "saved" and you define how it looks when it doesn't have the class "saved" (it's normal look). When you remove the class "saved", it will transition to the other state according to the transition settings in place for the object without the "saved" class.


> If the CSS transition settings apply to the object (without the "saved" class), then they will apply to both transitions.
